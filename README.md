## 🌍 Overview

### ✨ Features

This project showcases a clean and responsive feature section built with HTML and CSS.
It highlights four key product features—Supervisor, Team Builder, Karma, and Calculator—each represented by its own card with a unique accent color.
The layout is designed to adapt smoothly across devices, and subtle animations enhance the visual flow.
This project focuses on structured content, modern styling techniques, and a visually engaging user experience.

## My process

## 🛠️ My process

### 🧰 Built with

| Category  | Tools                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Structure | **Semantic HTML5 markup**       |
| Styles    | **CSS** and **Tailwind CSS v4** |

### 🧠 What I learned

- Improved my understanding of semantic HTML5 markup

- Explored creating animations to enhance the user experience

Here are the snippets which shows the card flexboxes:

```css
.feature-card {
    position: relative;
    max-width: 22.5rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    padding: 2rem;

    ...
}
```

```css
.helper-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 1.5rem;
}
```
